# maze-solver
Here is a project developed with a friend in object-oriented Java to find the shortest path to a maze (based on Dijkstra's algorithm)

To use this program, you must download the two attached files. 

The 'src' folder contains the Java programs. You must run the file "main.java" to display the graphical interface.

The 'data' folder contains examples of files to represent a maze. This program only works with rectangular mazes.

The legend is:

A <-> Arrival box

D <-> Departure box

E <-> Empty box

W <-> Wall box

When running 'main.java', you are asked to specify a maze file to open. You have the choice between using one of the files in the 'data' folder or one of your own. Note that you can modify the examples in the'data' folder as you wish.

It will finally be possible to modify the labyrinth directly from the graphical interface (only the size of the labyrinth cannot be modified once the file is opened). You will then be able to know the shortest route between the start and finish square. You can also save the new modified maze.

I remain available for more information (cymoux in GitHub)
